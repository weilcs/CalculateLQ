# CalculateLQ
This is an R script to calculate Location Quotient (LQ)

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;LQ=\frac{\frac{RegionalIndustryEmployment(e_{i})}{RegionalTotalEmployment(e)}}{\frac{ProvincialIndustryEmployment(E_{i})}{ProvincialTotalEmployment(E)}}" />

LQ is to measure how concentrated a particular industry is in a town as compared to the province.

If LQ > 1, it implies that the area has proportionally more workers employed in a specific industry sector than the province.
If LQ >= 1.25, it implies that the regional industry has potential to be classified as exporter.
If LQ < 1, it means that many indicate opprtunity to develop businesses in the local area.
